<p>Version 2.0 of <a href="http://github.com/foundry/OpenCVStitch">OpenCVStitch</a></p>

<p>This new version demonstrates how to mix Swift, Objective-C and C++ in one project whilst keeping the code clearly separate. The project starts life in Swift. The AppDelegate and View Controller are written in Swift. Swift cannot talk directly to C++ (which we need for OpenCV), so we provide an Objective-C++ wrapper class to mediate between Swift and C++. We also provide an Objective-C++ category on UIImage to mediate between UIImage and CV::Mat image formats. The CVWrapper header file is pure Objective-C. For <a href="https://github.com/foundry/OpenCVStitch">v1</a>(which doesn't use Swift) this separation was a matter of clean style. For v2, it is a requirement: if any C++ headers are included in the wrapper, the app will not compile (Swift won't like it).</p>

<p><strong>Intallation</strong><br>
To run the project you need to install the OpenCV framework:<br>
v3.0.0: available from <a href="http://opencv.org">opencv.org</a><br>
v2.4.9: installed via cocoaPods</p>

<p>v3.0.0: download the framework and drag it to your project. Include it in the <em>Link Binary With Libraries</em> section of Build Phases for the target.<br>
v2.4.9: Assuming you have first <a href="https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html">installed CocoaPods</a>, run 'pod install' in this directory to install OpenCV for the project. From then on, always open the project in XCode from the <code>SwiftStitch.xcworkspace</code> file that the pod install creates. </p>

<p><strong>Use</strong><br>
OpenCVStitch is a very simple iOS/openCV example showing basic use of the Stitcher class. The c++ code is adapted from a sample included with the openCV distribution.  </p>

<p>The app has almost no user interface. On launch, the stitching code operates on four sample images, displaying the result in a UIScrollView.</p>

<p><strong>OpenCVStitch Versions</strong><br>
Version 2.0 is built with XCode 6.3 / Swift 1.2 for iOS 7.0+<br>
<a href="https://github.com/foundry/OpenCVStitch">Version 1.0</a> is built with XCode 4.5.2 for iOS 5.1+   </p>

<p>Provides a partial answer to: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14062932/libraries-to-capture-panorama-in-ios-6/14064788#14064788">Libraries to capture panoramas in iOS 6</a> (Stack Overflow)</p>

<p><strong>OpenCV Versions</strong><br>
<em>OpenCV 3.x</em><br>
OpenCV 3.0.0 has just been released. There is no podspec avaiable, but the framework <em>does</em> just work if you download from <a href="http://opencv.org">http://opencv.org</a> and drag into the project. No need for cocoaPods with this version, and the stitching runs 85% faster on my iphone 5s - but seems to produce less accurate results.</p>

<p><em>OpenCV 2.4.x</em><br>
The openCV distribution is not as clean as we would like.<br>
2.4.10 - the pod spec and the distribution build for iOS <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28331397/cocoapods-opencv-2-4-10-linker-error/28820510">is broken</a><br>
2.4.9 - the pod spec <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31005022/cant-install-opencv-with-cocoapods-could-not-resolve-host-hivelocity-dl-sourc">is broken</a>. This is likely a result of relying on Sourceforge for hosting.  </p>

<p>Therefore we are using a <a href="https://github.com/Zi0P4tch0/Specs/tree/master/Specs/OpenCV">self-hosted podspec</a> (<em>thanks Matteo!</em>) until official channels are fixed. Specs are available for <a href="https://github.com/Zi0P4tch0/Specs/tree/master/Specs/OpenCV/2.4.9-zp">2.4.9</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Zi0P4tch0/Specs/tree/master/Specs/OpenCV/2.4.10-zp">2.4.10</a>, but as the latter won't run we use 2.4.9.</p>

<p><em>this version of OpenCVStitch opted to use cocoapods to overcome the notorious installation issues with previous versions of the openCV 2.4.x framework.. it seems our optimism was slightly premature!</em></p>
