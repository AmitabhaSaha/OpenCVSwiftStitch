The project starts life in Swift. The AppDelegate and View Controller are written in Swift. Swift cannot talk directly to C++ (which we need for OpenCV), so we provide an Objective-C++ wrapper class to mediate between Swift and C++. We also provide an Objective-C++ category on UIImage to mediate between UIImage and CV::Mat image formats. The CVWrapper header file is pure Objective-C. For [v1](https://github.com/foundry/OpenCVStitch)(which doesn't use Swift) this separation was a matter of clean style. For v2, it is a requirement: if any C++ headers are included in the wrapper, the app will not compile (Swift won't like it).\r\n\r\n__Intallation__  \r\nTo run the project you need to install the OpenCV framework:    \r\nv3.0.0: available from [opencv.org](http://opencv.org)  \r\nv2.4.9: installed via cocoaPods\r\n\r\nv3.0.0: download the framework and drag it to your project. Include it in the _Link Binary With Libraries_ section of Build Phases for the target.  \r\nv2.4.9: Assuming you have first [installed CocoaPods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html), run 'pod install' in this directory to install OpenCV for the project. From then on, always open the project in XCode from the `SwiftStitch.xcworkspace` file that the pod install creates. \r\n\r\n__Use__  \r\nOpenCVStitch is a very simple iOS/openCV example showing basic use of the Stitcher class. The c++ code is adapted from a sample included with the openCV distribution.  \r\n\r\nThe app has almost no user interface. On launch, the stitching code operates on four sample images, displaying the result in a UIScrollView.\r\n\r\n__OpenCVStitch Versions__  \r\nVersion 2.0 is built with XCode 6.3 / Swift 1.2 for iOS 7.0+  \r\n[Version 1.0](https://github.com/foundry/OpenCVStitch) is built with XCode 4.5.2 for iOS 5.1+   \r\n\r\nProvides a partial answer to: [Libraries to capture panoramas in iOS 6](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14062932/libraries-to-capture-panorama-in-ios-6/14064788#14064788) (Stack Overflow)\r\n\r\n__OpenCV Versions__  \r\n_OpenCV 3.x_   \r\nOpenCV 3.0.0 has just been released. There is no podspec avaiable, but the framework _does_ just work if you download from http://opencv.org and drag into the project. No need for cocoaPods with this version, and the stitching runs 85% faster on my iphone 5s - but seems to produce less accurate results.\r\n\r\n_OpenCV 2.4.x_  \r\nThe openCV distribution is not as clean as we would like.  \r\n2.4.10 - the pod spec and the distribution build for iOS [is broken](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28331397/cocoapods-opencv-2-4-10-linker-error/28820510)  \r\n2.4.9 - the pod spec [is broken](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31005022/cant-install-opencv-with-cocoapods-could-not-resolve-host-hivelocity-dl-sourc). This is likely a result of relying on Sourceforge for hosting.  \r\n\r\nTherefore we are using a [self-hosted podspec](https://github.com/Zi0P4tch0/Specs/tree/master/Specs/OpenCV) (_thanks Matteo!_) until official channels are fixed. Specs are available for [2.4.9](https://github.com/Zi0P4tch0/Specs/tree/master/Specs/OpenCV/2.4.9-zp) and [2.4.10](https://github.com/Zi0P4tch0/Specs/tree/master/Specs/OpenCV/2.4.10-zp), but as the latter won't run we use 2.4.9.\r\n\r\n_this version of OpenCVStitch opted to use cocoapods to overcome the notorious installation issues with previous versions of the openCV 2.4.x framework.. it seems our optimism was slightly premature!_\r\n\r\n\r\n__Comparisons__\r\n\r\n<table><tr>\r\n<td>OpenCV 2.4.9</td><td>OpenCV 3.0.0</td>\r\n</tr><tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<img src=\"https://github.com/foundry/OpenCVSwiftStitch/blob/master/meta/v2_inset2.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"375\" alt=\"v2_inset2\">\r\n\r\n\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<img src=\"https://github.com/foundry/OpenCVSwiftStitch/blob/master/meta/v3_inset2.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"375\" alt=\"v2_inset2\">\r\n\r\n\r\n</td>\r\n</tr><tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<img src=\"https://github.com/foundry/OpenCVSwiftStitch/blob/master/meta/v2_inset.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"375\" alt=\"v2_inset2\">\r\n\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<img src=\"https://github.com/foundry/OpenCVSwiftStitch/blob/master/meta/v3_inset.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"375\" alt=\"v2_inset2\">\r\n\r\n</td>\r\n</tr></table>\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
